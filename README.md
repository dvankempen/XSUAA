### Tutorial Video - Introduction ### 
In this first video of the series, we provide an introduction to the topic and cover SAP Cloud Platform security, Cloud Foundry security, and the UAA and XSUAA services.

### Tutorial Video - Business Logic App I ### 
In this second video of the series, we explore the "business logic app". This will be a simple Hello World app, using Node.js and Python, covering local development, dependencies, and start commands. We also show how we can bundle our app inside a Docker container.

### Tutorial Video - Business Logic App II ### 
In this third video of the series, we explore our options for deploying our "business logic app" to the cloud and specifically the Cloud Foundry environment. We look at deployment attributes, the manifest.yml attribute deployment file, differences between deploying different development languages (Node, Python, Java) and containers (Diego, Docker).  

To connect to the SAP Cloud Platform, set the API endpoint and login. You can use the cf target command to view or set the Cloud Foundry Org ans Space.
```
cf api https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com
cf l[ogin] --sso
cf t[arget]
```
To publish the app use the push command. 
```
cf push myapp --random-route
```

### Tutorial Video - Service Instances: SAP HANA Cloud and HDI Containers ### 
In this fourth video of the series, we cover how we can bind our Business Logic App to a Service Instance. There are many services available on the SAP Cloud Platform, Cloud Foundry environment. For our app, we will be using the SAP HANA Cloud service (trial) and the SAP HANA Schemas and HDI Container service.  

To view the available services use the cf marketplace command and use the -s <service name> for additional information like the available plans. 
```
cf m[arketplace]
cf m -s hana-cloud-trial
cf m -s hana
```

### Tutorial Video - Approuter and XSUAA Service ### 
In this fifth video of the series, we show how we can create and configure an instance of the XSUAA service and how to add an approuter to our app to serve as endpoint.   

```
# query the marketplace for the xsuaa service
cf m -s xsuaa
# create an instance using security descriptor file (choose one)
cf create-service xsuaa application myxsuaa -c xs-security.json
cf create-service xsuaa application myxsuaa -c '{"xsappname":"myapp", "tenant-mode":"dedicated"}'
# query service configuration
cf service myxsuaa
```

### Tutorial Video - XSUAA and Authentication ### 
In this sixth video of the series, we explore authentication using XSUAA service with some code changes to the business logic of our services app.

### Tutorial Video - XSUAA and Authorization ### 
n this seventh video of the series, we explore authorizarion using XSUAA service with some code changes to the business logic of our services app and to the front-end, the app router.
