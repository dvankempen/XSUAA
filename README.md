### Tutorial Video - Business Logic App I ### 
In this second video of the series, we explore the "business logic app". This will be a simple Hello World app, using Node.js and Python, covering local development, dependencies, and start commands. We also show how we can bundle our app inside a Docker container.

### Tutorial Video - Business Logic App II ### 
In this third video of the series, we explore our options for deploying our "business logic app" to the cloud and specifically the Cloud Foundry environment. We look at deployment attributes, the manifest.yml attribute deployment file, differences between deploying different development languages (Node, Python, Java) and containers (Diego, Docker).
